# Minesweeper
minigame :)

This project uses classes & functions in order to make a version or minesweeper work.

Playing it is straightforward, in the function 'output' the commented code only works for some sizes not all.


NEW FILE: minesweeperAI.py 
- Using a bit of help from ChatGPT, and the original minesweeper.py file as the base, I created a GUI version with an AI button to choose a good option for uncovering.
